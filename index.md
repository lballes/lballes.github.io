# Lukas Balles

I'm a machine learning scientist and engineer. I currently work at Amazon Web Services in Berlin.


## Research

I currently work on continual learning, in particular parameter-efficient continual fine-tuning of large language models.
During my PhD, I have been working on optimization methods for machine learning and still maintain an interest in this topic.
I have dabbled in a range of other topics, e.g., Gaussian processes, Bayesian methods, hyperparameter optimization, coresets, synthetic data generation, and mroe.

## Short Bio

I studied Mathematics (B.Sc.) and Scientific Computing (M.Sc.) at Heidelberg University and spent some time as a visiting student at Tsinghua University in Beijing.
I did my Master's thesis research project at (what is now) the [Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.bosch-ai.com).
After that, I obtained a PhD in machine learning at the [International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/), hosted by the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems and the University of Tuebingen. I was supervised by [Prof. Philipp Hennig](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/computer-science/lehrstuehle/methods-of-machine-learning/content/philipp-hennig/).
During my PhD, I interned in the Google Brain team in Montreal and at Google AI in Zurich.
Since 2020, I have been working as an Applied Scientist at Amazon Web Services in Berlin.
