## Short Bio

I previously was a doctoral student in machine learning at the [International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/), hosted by the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems and the University of Tuebingen. I am supervised by [Prof. Philipp Hennig](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/computer-science/lehrstuehle/methods-of-machine-learning/content/philipp-hennig/).
Prior to joining the Max Planck Institute as a Ph.D. student, I studied Mathematics (B.Sc.) and Scientific Computing (M.Sc.) at Heidelberg University and spent some time as a visiting student at Tsinghua University in Beijing.
I did my Master's thesis research project at (what is now) the [Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.bosch-ai.com).
During my PhD, I interned in the Google Brain team in Montreal and at Google AI in Zurich.
